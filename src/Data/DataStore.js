           details:'Gal Gadot is not just the protagonist in "Heart of Stone" but the actress has also turned producer for the Netflix film. In one of her statements recorded in 2022 and early 2023 before the SAG strike, the Hollywood star shared, "Its really fulfilling to do both, because not only do you have input over the project as a whole, but your role in the film as well. It is really rewarding. I especially liked being involved in the story from the very beginning. It has made the role of Rachel Stone feel much more personal. You want your audiences to be visually interested. I like to think of going to the movies as an opportunity to experience interesting places. Not everyone gets to go to amazing places like Iceland, Italy, Portugal, the UK or Senegal. So beyond great action, you get to see these locations you may not otherwise experience." Gal Gadot and the "Heart of Stone" team aimed to create an immersive experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional spy films. She wanted to transport the audience to mesmerising places they might only dream of visiting. From the awe-inspiring landscapes of Iceland to the timeless charm of Italy, from the vibrant streets of Portugal to the grandeur of the UKs historic sites, and even the lively spirit of Senegal - each location became an integral part of the films narrative.',

           details:'RD Burman found himself on this flight with the eminent superstar of that era, Rajesh Khanna. The story behind this iconic song, vividly recounted in the book ‘R D Burman – The Prince of Music’, reveals how this enchanting melody was created thousands of feet above the ground. According to the author, Khagesh Dev Burman, Rajesh Khanna was feeling rather agitated and requested RD to soothe his nerves with a melody. RD readily accepted the challenge and crafted the melody that eventually evolved into the celebrated song ‘Ye jo mohabbat hai’, to the absolute delight of his fellow passengers.Rajesh Khanna was so entranced by the impromptu performance that he convinced his friend Shakti Samanta, the producer-director of the 1971 film ‘Kati Patang’, to make room for the song in the movie. This serendipitous series of events led to the song being included in the film, which was already in production. Consequently, ‘Ye jo mohabbat hai’ turned out to be a classic that resonated deeply with its listeners and swiftly became a fan favorite.However, despite the popularity of the song, Kishore Kumar, the playback singer, fell short of winning the Filmfare Best Singer Award. Instead, it was Manna Dey who received the accolade for his song ‘Ae Bhai Zara Dekh Ke Chal’ from the Raj Kapoor cult classic ‘Mera Naam Joker’.',

           details:'Gal Gadot has become inseparable from the character of Wonder Woman in the present day. But the trials and tribulations of making it to the top in such a competitive industry are only known to the Israeli actor. Starting from facing rejection in an audition for the Bond girl role in Quantum of Solace (2008), to ultimately etching her name in history with earning a star on the prestigious Hollywood Walk of Fame, Gal has reached great heights during the span of her remarkable career.Whats even more uncommon is her achievement in an unfamiliar countrys film industry, where she wasnt originally from. In that aspect, her journey is akin to her Heart of Stone co-star, Alia Bhatt. Alia, who embarked on her acting career in Bollywood with Karan Johars Student of the Year in 2012, has made remarkable progress over the course of a decade. Her most recent accomplishment involves her international debut, acting alongside Gal Gadot in the upcoming spy thriller Heart of Stone directed by Tom Harper.In an exclusive conversation with an Indian news outlet, Gal mentioned that observing Alia navigate the initial phases of Hollywood does evoke memories of her own struggles.“We share so much in common. From the very first time we met, I felt we connected. Not just because both of us are from different countries and English is not our native language and the culture we come from is very different, but she brings a lot of warmth with her ... You get what you see,” Gal was quoted as saying.',

           details:'Directed and co-written by Alejandro Monteverde, it is the fictionalized version of the heroism of Tim Ballard, a former US government agent who crusaded against child sex traffickers in Colombia. The movie stars Jim Caviezel, Mira Sorvino, and Bill Camp.Much of the criticism of the movie emanates from the fact that Caviezel is a QAnon believer. According to BBC, “At its heart, QAnon is a wide-ranging, completely unfounded theory that says that [former US] President [Donald] Trump is waging a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping pedophiles in government, business and the media. QAnon believers have speculated that this fight will lead to a day of reckoning where prominent people such as former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will be arrested and executed.” That a section of Trump supporters believe in QAnon has caught the imagination of Leftists and Liberals (There is little difference between the two groups these days). In fact, QAnon is one of the terms intellectuals use to demonize anyone they don’t like, the other terms being ‘far-Right’ and ‘alt-Right’: There is no such thing as the Right in the ideological spectrum these days, only far-Right and alt-Right.The situation is similar to the one that prevailed in India in the 1970s, the 1980s, and even the 1990s: Those who were disliked by the intellectual establishment were maligned as RSS sympathizers, as ‘knicker-wallahs,’ even if those people themselves despised the RSS!However, Liberals are not raving and ranting against Sound of Freedom just because of the protagonist’s belief; their depravity is far deeper and more insidious; it is unconscionable. For they have been imbibing the Left’s ideas on children and child sex—and all these ideas are, well… radical, in every possible sense of the word.',

           details:'At the beginning of last month, Meta introduced Threads, a new text-based social media platform. The launch of Threads had been making headlines for quite some time and when the app finally launched, people were quite eager to give it a try.  By using their Instagram credentials, users can easily sign in to Threads and start sharing their thoughts with the world. This new app launched at a time when many were becoming disinterested in Twitter due to various alterations, including limiting user activity. Therefore, Threads was thought to be a potential substitute for Twitter, which has now been renamed as X.The app had a whopping 100 million sign-ups within 5 days of launch. Threads was also reported to be one of the fastest growing social media sites. However, a few weeks after its launch, reports had surfaced that Threads lost more than half of its subscribers. Reports also said that Meta is planning to add features to Threads in order to retain users.And as per fresh reports, a web version of the app might be launching soon. In addition to this, the company might also add search functionality in the app.According to a Reuters report, Threads is planning to add a mention button so that the users will be able to mention someones account in a Threads post without any hassle. In addition to this, the company will also be launching a web version of the app. Presently, Threads can be accessed only via your phone, through its app. The web-version is not there yet. However, people can still view a Threads post via web if they have the direct link. Launching a web version will mean that people will be able to log in to Threads via web too, just like they can do with Twitter. And this might prove to be beneficial for Meta as desktop users will directly experience Threads instead of picking up their phone to use the app. With that being said, nothing is certain for now and we must wait for an official announcement from Meta to see if the web version is being launched or not.Apart from this, the company is also looking to add search functionality in the coming weeks, the report added.

           details:'Samsung is adding a new phone to its popular F-series with the launch of the Galaxy F34. The phone packs class-leading features, which include a 120Hz AMOLED screen, a 6,000 mAh battery, and four years of promised software updates.Available in two colour options — Electric Black and Mystic Green, the smartphone comes in two storage variants. As an introductory offer, the base model with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage costs Rs 18,999, the 8 GB and 128 GB storage version is priced at Rs 20,999. HDFC bank card users can get a flat Rs 2,000 discount, which brings down the price of the phone to Rs 16,999.The Samsung Galaxy F34 is quite similar to the Galaxy M34 (review) that we recently reviewed. The device comes with a mid-sized 6.5-inch AMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Similarly, the smartphone is based on the in-house Exynos 1280 octa-core processor, paired with 6/8 GB RAM and 128 GB of internal storage.The triple camera array at the back consists of a 50 MP primary camera with OIS, an 8 MP ultra-wide angle lens, and a 2 MP macro lens. The smartphone also has a 13 MP selfie camera. This time around, Samsung has introduced a lot of camera features like Nightography for enhanced low light shots, and it even has a Fun mode with 16 in-built lens effects.The phone ships with Android 13-based OneUI 5 and the device is eligible to receive four years of software updates and five years of security updates. Besides, a 6,000 mAh battery fuels the device with support for 25W fast charging. However, the retail box of the phone only includes a cable and the charger has to be bought separately.The launch of the Galaxy F34 comes at a time when Samsung is facing still competition from Chinese smartphone players. According to the latest IDC report, Samsung is the second biggest smartphone brand in India with a 15.7 per cent market share. The company has been maintaining this momentum for the last few quatres with the launch of entry-level, mid-range, and high-end smartphones.',

           details:'Apple has recently filed a patent for a simple head-mounted display that you can insert your iPhone into. While the device is yet to move beyond the patent stage, it could one day offer a cheaper and easier way to experience VR than the upcoming Apple Vision Pro, which costs a whopping $3,499.The patent, which is the 17th one of its kind, describes a pair of glasses that can hold your phone in front of your eyes. The phone then acts as the main screen, displaying VR content. This is similar to how Samsung’s Gear VR works, although Apple did file patents for this concept long before Gear VR was launched.But Apple’s device is not just a glorified phone holder. It also has some interesting features that could make it more versatile and user-friendly. For example, it could come with a remote control that lets you change what you see on the screen, or a touch sensor that lets you adjust the volume by sliding your finger on the glasses.Another proposed feature is the external viewing mode, which allows you to see the real world through the glasses. This could solve one of the main problems of VR and AR: feeling isolated from your surroundings. The Apple Vision Pro also has this feature, but it uses advanced cameras and sensors to create a realistic view of the environment.',

           details:'I recall my own childhood, which was different from the experiences of today"s kids. Unlike the present generation, we didn"t have easy access to gadgets like smartphones, laptops, and social media. These resources offer the new generation exposure to novel ideas, concepts, languages, and skills.However, the blessings of this interconnected world come with struggles and challenges. As educators and parents, it"s crucial to acknowledge these unique issues. Despite the benefits, we must recognize the problems our children face.Today, it"s common to see children constantly glued to their mobile phones. Ensuring their safe and responsible gadget usage is essential. It"s vital that they also have opportunities for exploring the physical world and engaging in outdoor activities. Each child is unique, and what suits one might not suit another.Let"s not ignore the adverse effects of gadget use, including eye strain, sleep disturbances, delayed development, and social isolation. Excessive reliance on technology hinders social development, limiting communication skills and relationship-building.',

           details:'Breastfeeding brings numerous benefits, yet mothers often encounter challenges. From sore nipples and engorgement to low milk supply and latch difficulties, these common issues can create frustration. Understanding and addressing these hurdles are essential for a successful and fulfilling breastfeeding experience for both mother and baby.“Breastfeeding presents several common challenges that mothers often encounter, requiring careful attention to ensure a positive experience for both mother and baby. One significant issue is the lack of support, while normal delivery enables easier milk flow, cesarean delivery may delay milk production by 24-36 hours, coupled with the mother’s post-surgery recovery and discomfort. Family support during this critical period is important, allowing the mother to rest adequately and ensuring she can breastfeed every 2 hours without unnecessary strain,” says Dr Nivedita Kaul, Lead Consultant, Dept of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at the CK Birla Hospital (R), Delhi.Secondly, inadequate milk supply is another concern raised by many mothers. Proper nutrition, starting from pregnancy, plays a crucial role in preparing for breastfeeding. “A well-balanced diet rich in protein and calcium is essential. Hydration is equally vital, with breastfeeding mothers needing to drink at least 2 litres of water daily to maintain milk production,” adds Dr Kaul.Thirdly, breast engorgement is a distressing issue that arises from excessive milk production. It leads to heaviness, pain, and redness in the breast, and if not addressed promptly, may even cause fever. Dr Kaul states, “It is crucial to educate mothers on emptying their breasts adequately during breastfeeding and seeking immediate attention for engorgement. The support of a family member or lactation expert can be immensely valuable during this time.”Sore nipples are yet another challenge faced by breastfeeding mothers. “Aggressive sucking or biting from the baby can cause painful cuts and soreness. To alleviate this, mothers can use nipple ointments, or shields, or opt for manual expression of milk to provide the nipples with some rest,” explains Dr Kaul.',

           details:'There are several ways to help prevent a perilous rise in core temperature while being physically active in the heat. There are numerous pre-cooling strategies that can help. Most practical of those is consuming a cold drink (or better yet, an ice slurry or slushie) prior to exercise. But “training” your body to cope better in the heat is the best defence.The strategy of heat training is particularly important for endurance athletes. Athletes who incorporate even a modest heat acclimating protocol before competing in the heat on average perform better and are less likely to require medical attention for heat-related injuries.However, given our warming environment, it may be time to consider heat training even for non-athletes, especially for people working outdoors.While heat acclimation training is most often used by endurance athletes, it was first developed for underground gold mine workers in the 1940s, who were exposed to environmental temperatures exceeding 50 C with humidity near 100 per cent.The benefits of heat acclimation are a growing area of research. In fact, the benefits seem to extend beyond being more heat tolerant, and into improvements for general cardiovascular health — known as heat therapy.Heat acclimatization and heat acclimation are slightly different: It is called heat acclimatization when it occurs naturally over a longer period, and heat acclimation when done “artificially” or purposefully over a shorter duration. Both forms confer benefits for heat tolerance, but they are not entirely synonymous.',

           details:'Planks and push-ups are two popular bodyweight exercises that mainly target the core muscle. Both can be done nearly anywhere as neither do they require any equipment, or much space. But is one exercise better than the other when it comes to achieving your fitness goals? To get the answers, we turned to an expert.According to Aminder Singh, a fitness expert and founder of Team Aminder, planks are a form of isometric exercise that engage the core muscles, including the abdominals, buttocks, thighs, upper back, and lower back. "By performing planks, you can strengthen multiple muscle groups simultaneously via contractions," he told indianexpress.com.On the other hand, pushups are a kind of calisthenics exercise that utilise your body weight as resistance. "They are useful for enhancing upper body strength," he added.Talking about the advantages of performing planks, Singh said that this exercise involves applying force without any movement, making it a versatile and beneficial exercise for individuals with varying fitness levels. "Another crucial advantage of planks is that there are numerous variations of them to suit individual abilities. Whether you are older, more fragile, or muscular, the plank can be customised to fulfill your specific needs and goals," he added.',

           details:'Stroke is the second commonest cause of death in India with one stroke-related death every four minutes. In fact, one in four people is in danger of stroke in their lifetime, according to the World Health Organisation.A new study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, has shown that brain wave stimulation could be beneficial for stroke patients, especially those undergoing rehabilitation.In the first-in-human trial of deep brain stimulation (DBS), scientists found that the research showed improvements in both motor function and impairment in 9 out of 12 participants.Known as the EDEN trial, this method stands for Electrical Stimulation of the Dentate Nucleus for Upper Extremity Hemiparesis Due to Ischemic Stroke.It targets the dentate nucleus in the brain responsible for controlling cognition, sensory functions, smooth working of voluntary movements, and language.The scientists from Cleveland Clinic found it safe and feasible for the brain while using this method."These are reassuring for patients as the participants in the study had been disabled for more than a year and, in some cases, three years after stroke. This gives us a potential opportunity for much needed improvements in rehabilitation in the chronic phases of stroke recovery," said Dr Machado, chair of Cleveland Clinic’s Neurological Institute.',

However, the program"s extreme nature and lack of flexibility pose significant drawbacks.Its rigid rules, such as no cheat meals and the requirement for outdoor workouts regardless of weather conditions, can lead to burnout and make it difficult for participants to maintain these habits post-challenge.Its rigid rules, such as no cheat meals and the requirement for outdoor workouts regardless of weather conditions, can lead to burnout and make it difficult for participants to maintain these habits post-challenge.',

One significant risk factor is the Helicobacter pylori infection, which can damage the stomachs protective lining, leading to inflammation and cell damage.Unhealthy dietary habits, such as consuming smoked, salted, or pickled foods while neglecting fruits and vegetables, have also been linked to a higher risk of stomach cancer. Additionally, tobacco and alcohol use, a family history of gastrointestinal cancers, and previous stomach surgery for conditions like peptic ulcers may increase the risk.It often develops silently in its early stages, making it challenging to detect. However, common symptoms may include persistent indigestion, abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. It is very crucial to understand its causes, recent progress in treatment, and prevention strategies from the expert Dr R V Raghunandan, Senior Consultant Radiation Oncologist, HCG MNR Cancer Centre, Ongole.Stomach cancer develops when the cells lining the stomach undergo abnormal changes, leading to the growth of tumours',

           details:'Staying fit in your earlier years can significantly lower the risk of developing various types of cancer later in life, a recent study suggested.While earlier research suggests that physical activity can prevent certain types of cancer, the new study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, examined the link between aerobic fitness and the risk of subsequently being diagnosed with 18 different types of cancer.The analyses are based on data from 1,078,000 men who underwent military conscription in Sweden between 1968 and 2005, with an average age of 18 years.The study showed that proper fitness at the time of conscription was followed by a lower risk of developing cancer of the head and neck, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, colon, rectum, kidney, and lungs.The research revealed that individuals with good cardio-respiratory fitness had a remarkable 42 per cent reduced risk of lung cancer, 40 per cent reduced risk of liver cancer, and 39 per cent reduced risk of oesophageal cancer.However, the study did uncover a slight increase in the risk of prostate and skin cancers among those with higher cardio-respiratory fitness, potentially due to factors such as increased screening for prostate cancer and greater exposure to sunlight.',

           details:'Millet, millet, everywhere – this paraphrasing of a Coleridge poem is only a slight exaggeration in India, a country which is one of the largest producers and exporters of the grain in the world. Millets are present in cuisines across the country, be it Punjab’s bajre di roti, mudde or hittu in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, ragi kali in Tamil Nadu, or jowar bhakri in Maharashtra.As health and wellness become paramount for Indians and sustainability becomes their guiding light, millets are increasingly emerging as a unique culinary alchemy that blend nutrition, tradition, and innovation into a single grain.“The history of millet in India reaches back to the dawn of civilisation on the subcontinent but, for the longest time, the grain was a victim of its own success. Being so widely available and affordable, it was relegated to the status of a meal for the masses, a mota anaaj (thick grain) which is not very suitable for consumption and was often replaced in diets by grains perceived to be ‘richer’, such as rice and wheat, whenever possible,” says Shilpa Vora, Chief R&D Officer, Marico Limited.In recent years, the grain category has registered a refreshing change of perception. Its value as a rich source of protein, fibre, micronutrients, essential amino acids, and phytochemicals is catching public attention. “The health benefits of a millet-based diet extend to blood sugar regulation, satiety, and improved heart health. Combined with being high in antioxidants, these factors are leading to a drastic re-evaluation of millets’ status and driving its awareness as a superfood,” adds Vora.',

         details:'We have a complicated relationship with sugar. The natural phenomenon of tilting towards a brownie after a heavy meal is indispensable, especially if you’re undergoing those indescribable monthly cravings.While our body does need sugar, the consumption of excessive refined or white sugar can pose detrimental effects on both our physical and mental well-being. Giving into cravings might not be such a bad idea once in a while, but daily consumption could be questionable.Skin expert Dr Geetika Mittal Gupta shared an Instagram post earlier today about the impact of sugar on our skin and how regular intake of it can cause some serious damage to the top layer.“Did you know that indulging in sweet treats can wreak havoc on your skin? Sugar can lead to various skin concerns that affect your complexion and overall skin health. Lets explore the impact and discover alternatives for a radiant, youthful glow,” she wrote in her post.',

         details:'Galouti Kebabs, hailing from the exotic land of the nawabs Lucknow, has bagged a place amongst the worlds best lamb dishes.Taste Atlas, an experiential travel online guide for traditional food, released its list of the World’s Best 50 Lamb Dishes with the Lucknow delicacy occupying the 26th spot. A well-deserved accolade, we must add, given the undeniably delicious flavor and unique texture of these melt-in-your-mouth delicacies.While a visit to Lucknow is incomplete without devouring these delicious kebabs, you can also treat yourself to the subtle burst of flavours by making Galouti Kebabs at home. We bring you the recipe from Chef Ranveer Brar, who himself grew up in Lucknow.Grab your chef’s hat, ramp up your kitchen, and let the fragrant magic of Galouti Kebabs unfold.To make the fine mince, Chef Ranveer suggested combining 1kg of minced mutton with 200gm of lamb kidney fat. The mixture should be minced properly to ensure a perfectly-textured base for the kebabs.The secret to the dishs intriguing taste is "Galawat ka Masala." It includes a mix of exotic ingredients like betel leaf root, vetiver root, and wild berries along with everyday spices such as black cumin seeds, green cardamoms, and cloves. Fret not, if you can’t find these spices, as Chef Ranveer also suggested an easy way in the video.All of these are finely ground to create an aromatic, flavour-packed masala that lends depth and character to the kebabs.After this, the chef instructed home cooks to mix the minced meat with the prepared spice mix, ginger garlic juice, raw papaya paste, brown cashew paste, brown onion paste, kewra water, and rose water. Add a hint of red chilli for that extra kick, while a pinch of salt brings out all the exciting flavours. To allow for the mingling of these distinctive tastes, the meat mixture should be marinated for at least two hours, or even better, overnight.Finally, you just need to take a flat pan. Heat ghee on medium heat for shallow frying. Wet your hands with water and take a portion of the meat mixture and place it directly on the pan while shaping them into patties. Fry till a golden crust is formed on both sides and evenly cooked.',

         details:'Things are not looking up for Harry and Meghan and they are completely failing as a brand. According to The Mirror report, it’s been suggested that Meghan Markle may be looking for a project to “solidify her position as a member of the global elite,” amid speculation over her career moving forward.Meghan rose to fame as an actor but has ventured away from acting in recent years. She’s since hosted her own podcast Archetypes and worked with her husband Prince Harry, 38, on projects like docuseries Harry & Meghan. In a big career move, Meghan signed with William Morris Endeavor (WME) which has also represented major stars including Adele, and tennis player Serena Williams.  PR expert Kieran Elsby has told that Meghan will be “a major coup for the agency”. “It is good business to have her on their roster. It is also good for Meghan having a prestige agency.“However, it’s been three months since the news broke and we’ve heard nothing since. This is a longer period of time than is typically expected for a new client to secure deals, which suggests that Meghan may be struggling to find her footing in Hollywood.”Amid all the speculation, communication expert Andy Barr told the Mirror: “The big question right now is, what will Megan do next and this is one of the reasons why she signed up to WME, the talent agency of the Hollywood elite.”“They will have been working away behind the scenes trying to find her a big ticket commercial or acting opportunity that will solidify her position as a member of the global elite,” he further commented about the possible plans.He suggested she could make a cameo on a potential Suits revival or reunion, saying: “I don’t think she will want to take a perceived backward step into a regular appearance on Suits, but maybe the odd cameo will happen.

         details:'And yet, the longer the strike goes on, the more harm it’s doing to the UK economy. Since the Screen Actors Guild walked out on July 14, joining the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines Hollywood – the world’s oldest and richest entertainment industry – has simply shut down. The money Los Angeles was expecting to pay for film and TV shows in 2023 was estimated at $240 billion – roughly the turnover of Google, almost twice the turnover of Ford, and four times the turnover of Boeing. With London the world’s third largest production hub, studios across the country and film and TV crews usually rated the best in the world in industry surveys, a chunk of that was headed our way.In 2022, according to figures from the BFI, inward investment from Hollywood on films and high-end television was £5.37 billion. LA studios spent £3.62 billion making TV over here whilst UK companies spent £632.7 million. With films, the US spent £1.74 billion in UK studios and locations whilst domestic films accounted for £173.6 million. In 2023, the rate of investment was similar in the first quarter of the year, suggesting that a second half shutdown will lose us almost £3 billion.The UK’s biggest studios host major US productions, all of which are now on hold. These include Deadpool 3, which has been filming at Pinewood, Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice sequel, the Brad Pitt Formula One drama Apex, the next Mission: Impossible film and the movie version of the hit musical Wicked, whose Yellow Brick Road set now lies in ruins in the Buckinghamshire countryside. TV shows in production and now under threat are second seasons of Andor and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and Eddie Redmayne’s The Day of the Jackal. For the electricians, labourers, camera crew and sound technicians, almost all of whom are freelance, this came as a sharp financial shock.  ',

Speaking to ELLE about her style, she explained, "I think we all start looking a little funny when we get older. And I am kind of laughing at myself when I look at the mirror. I go, Wow, this is really ... what is happening to me? It is a journey."Despite this, Pamela said to being in a "good place" at the moment. The "Baywatch" star, who became a global sex symbol in the 90s, shared, "I feel rooted for. I feel good. I am in a good place."

         details:'After Bradley Cooper’s prosthetic nose in the trailer for the upcoming Leonard Bernstein biopic “Maestro” stoked criticism of antisemitism, the conductor’s children have come to the defense of the actor.The teaser trailer for “Maestro,” which Cooper directs and stars in, debuted Tuesday and offered the first close-up look at Cooper’s makeup and performance as the great American composer and longtime music director of the New York Philharmonic. Cooper, who is not Jewish, dons a prosthetic nose as part of his transformation into Bernstein, who was.To some, Cooper’s nose in the trailer seemed like the kind of outsized caricature that has been a regular feature of Jewish portrayals throughout film history. The nonprofit group Stop Antisemitism called it “sickening.”“Hollywood cast Bradley Cooper — a non-Jew — to play Jewish legend Leonard Bernstein and stuck a disgusting exaggerated ‘Jew nose’ on him,” the group tweeted on X.Bernstein’s three children — Jamie, Alexander and Nina Bernstein — on Wednesday issued a statement supporting Cooper, saying they were “touched to the core to witness the depth of (Cooper’s) commitment, his loving embrace of our father’s music and the sheer open-hearted joy he brought to his exploration.”“It breaks our hearts to see any misrepresentations or misunderstandings of his efforts,” the statement said. “It happens to be true that Leonard Bernstein had a nice, big nose. Bradley chose to use makeup to amplify his resemblance, and we’re perfectly fine with that. We’re also certain that our dad would have been fine with it as well.”',

         details:'Director Ángel Manuel Soto didn’t think too much about the “Latino side of things” when visually crafting DC’s “Blue Beetle” alongside Mexican screenwriter Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer.The film — starring “Cobra Kai’s” Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes, aka Blue Beetle and DC’s first Latino superhero — oozes with Mexican references and elements of other Latin American cultures through almost every scene. Still, the Puerto Rican director says that all of this came naturally due to his and Dunnet-Alcocer’s backgrounds.“We never were like, ‘Okay, so how are we going to make this Latino?’ We cannot hide who we are. If we have the opportunity to tell our collective experiences because we are Latino, they’re going to come out Latino.”In “Blue Beetle,” Reyes finds himself in possession of an ancient scarab named Khaji Da made of alien biotechnology that chooses Reyes as its symbiotic host. In a hilarious scene, the scarab attaches itself to Reyes, transforming the hesitant young adult into a superhero.Soto is promoting the film by himself due to the ongoing Hollywood strikes, which prohibit actors and screenwriters from promoting work under television and theatrical contracts. Still, he made sure to bring his cast along for the ride via a culturally relevant white shirt with illustrations of his lead cast as Mexican Loteria characters during the Los Angeles leg of the press tour. The game is similar to bingo and is popular in Mexican and Mexican-American households.',

         details:'Filmmaker R Balki considers himself lucky to have the admiration of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Balki, who has worked with his son Abhishek Bachchan in the upcoming movie Ghoomer, recently shared what Big B did after watching his last release, Chup: Revenge of an Artist. Starring Dulquer Salmaan, Pooja Bhatt, Sunny Deol and Shreya Dhanwanthary, Chup revolves around a cinema-obsessed serial killer who murders film criticsBalki revealed that senior Bachchan watched Chup at 5.30 am and as soon as he finished watching the film, he dropped an ’emotional’ message to the filmmaker. ‘I can’t talk, I am choking up. Can I meet you in the afternoon?’ Big B wrote to Balki.After seeing his message, the director went to meet him. Upon meeting Balki, Amitabh Bachchan told him “great things” about Chup. The filmmaker shared with Bollywood Spy, “Then he took me to a side room and told me, ‘I just didn’t want to speak to anybody and I just wanted to kind of absorb the movie. I just played this tune to myself, this is my feeling of Chup,’ and then he played that melody. I just took that from him. He asked me, ‘What are you going to do with it?’ I told him I would use it in the end credits. It was the purest way somebody could, without a single word, say something about a movie.”Balki feels Amitabh Bachchan is a “true artiste” and not just an actor. He added, “I was so touched with the purity of that thought. He is an artiste. More than The Amitabh Bachchan, the star, he is almost one of the purest artistes. He can switch between commercialism to scene in a flash but when it comes to the purity of a scene, he is one hundred percent there. He is more modern than any of the young guys.

         details:'The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced that the landing module, comprising the Vikram lander and Pragyan rover, has successfully separated from the propulsion module, marking a significant milestone in the mission.This maneuver will allow the Vikram lander to descend to a slightly lower orbit, preparing it for its final descent onto the lunar surface.The deboosting operation follows a series of successful maneuvers since the launch of Chandrayaan-3 on July 14, 2023. The spacecraft completed five Earth-bound maneuvers between July 15 and 25. Following this, ISRO carried out the trans-lunar injection on August 1, setting the spacecraft on a path towards the Moon, where it arrived on August 5.Once the deboosting maneuver is completed, a series of operations will be carried out to put Vikram in an orbit where the Perilune (closest point to Moon) is 30km and Apolune (farthest point from Moon) is 100km. This will set the stage for the most critical part of the landing - reducing the velocity of the lander from a 30km height to the final landing.The lander has been designed to handle multiple failures, including the malfunctioning of all sensors and even two of its engines. Despite these potential challenges, the lander is expected to make a soft landing, thanks to its robust design and the meticulous planning of the ISRO team.',

         details:'The aircraft is to be assembled by 2026 and flight testing will begin in 2027. The effort aims to mature BWB technology and demonstrate its capabilities, giving the department and commercial industry more options for future air platforms.With a design that differs from a traditional tube-and-wing aircraft, the BWB blends the aircraft body into its high-aspect-ratio wing, decreasing aerodynamic drag by at least 30 per cent and providing additional lift.This increased efficiency will enable extended range, more loiter time, and increased payload delivery efficiencies, capabilities that are vital to mitigating logistics risks."Blended wing body aircraft have the potential to significantly reduce fuel demand and increase global reach," said Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall. "Moving forces and cargo quickly, efficiently, and over long distances is a critical capability to enable national security strategy."Several military transport configurations are possible with the BWB. Together, these aircraft types account for approximately 60% of the Air Forces total annual jet fuel consumption. As outlined in the fiscal year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, the Department of Defense plans to invest $235 million over the next four years to fast-track the development of this transformational dual-use technology, with additional private investment expected.

And in fact, at a starting price of Rs 10,999, which is Rs 1,500 more than the Poco M5 is starting price, the M6 Pro does bring some meaningful upgrades to the table, such as 5G, a newer chipset and a tweaked design. So, the question is — should you buy this new budget phone from Poco, or does it even warrant an upgrade over the Poco M5? Let me try to answer this for you.',
         image:'https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1flMa5.img?w=612&h=344&m=6',
         details:'Design-wise, the Poco M6 Pro does a bunch of things right when compared to the Poco M5. Gone is the curved textured plastic back in favour of the premium glass rear, which is now flat. The raised camera island on the Poco M5 is now flush on the Poco M6 Pro, although the camera rings are slightly protruding. The Poco M6 Pro also features IP53 dust and splash resistance, something that is not there on the Poco M5.The side frame and button placements feel the same. However, the display now features a hole-punch design instead of the tear-drop notch, which is a welcome addition. And coming back to the buttons — they have superb tactile feedback, and the fingerprint reader is embedded in the power button. Fast and responsive, as one would expect from physical sensors. Other than this, the type-C port and single-speaker placement at the bottom remains the same. As well as the headphone jack and IR blaster at the top.Also note, the Poco M6 Pro features a hybrid SIM slot, which is good. However, in the budget segment, I was expecting to see dual SIM slots along with a dedicated slot for storage expansion. Overall, when it comes to the design, the Poco M6 Pro does not give you the feel that you are holding a budget phone. The build is solid, you get IP53 protection and the flat design plus the glass back does add up that bit of premiumness, which makes the phone feel more like a Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 device. And yeah, one more thing, why is not there a yellow colour Poco? Apart from the slight increase in size, i.e. from 6.58" on the Poco M5 to 6.79" on the Poco M6 Pro, the display specs on the newer model remain the same, i.e. you get an IPS LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate, Gorilla Glass 3 protection, and slightly bumped up brightness from 500 nits on the M5 to 550 nits on the M6 Pro.

These potential customers for the GLC are now going to get a refreshed new look that is more rounded compared to the model it replaces. The design changes are more apparent in the LED headlamps, the new grille, the redesigned rear tail lamps and the general look of the new GLC which now appears softer yet, more stately. The new 19-inch wheels ups the aesthetics even further and that is a good thing as no AMG-line additions are currently on offer for the SUV. The SUV also sees an increase of 60mm in overall length including a 15mm increase in wheelbase, more on the benefits of it later.',

         details:'Both yoga and pilates are low-impact workouts, however, each of them has its own benefits. Both of them come with their benefits and limitations and therefore, it is upto you to decide which one suits you best. Here, take a look at the benefits of yoga and pilates to choose the best one for you.Pilates can help to increase muscle strength and improve flexibility. It can also help with posture and reduce pain in the muscles and joints. This form of exercise focuses majorly on small movements of the body. Pilates can be done on a mat or using equipments. These equipments are made using springs, and levers, and it uses your body to give it resistance. Pilates can help you if you are suffering from arthritis, respiratory conditions, joint injuries and back pain among others.Yoga has several branches and there are different forms of yoga. Breathing and mindfulness are the most important parts of yoga. Yoga can also help to cure diseases and health conditions if they are detected in the early stages. It combines physical activity and mindful focus and can increase awareness of breathing and energy. Yoga can also help if you are suffering from several health conditions such as anxiety, arthritis, respiratory conditions, high blood pressure, chronic pain and others.Both yoga and pilates are great workouts by themselves. However, depending on your concerns you can choose either of them.There are different forms of yoga which requires flexibility and mobility. However, certain poses can be modified depending on an individual’s limitations and pain. Pilates on the other hand is a form of exercise which can help if you’re recovering from injuries due to its subtle movements. You can choose between mat pilates and equipment-based pilates. Both of these are great, however, mat pilates might be challenging if you have low mobility or poor core strength.        ',

         details:'Adults who lead an inactive life experience three to eight percent loss of muscle mass per decade, apart from fat accumulation, notes a 2012 study published by the US National Library of Medicine. Fitness enthusiasts will tell you to go for strength training, but some may urge you to try resistance training. Now comes the important question. How are strength training and resistance training different?trength training is a form of physical exercise that focuses on building and developing muscle strength and endurance through resistance or weight training exercises, celebrity coach and athlete Rohit Nair tells Health Shots. It basically involves using machines, free weights or bodyweight exercises.it is true that strength training and resistance training are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two.Strength training focuses primarily on increasing muscle strength and power. It involves lifting heavy weights for a lower number of repetitions, typically in the range of 1 to 6 repetitions per set. The emphasis is on challenging the muscles with maximum resistance to stimulate muscle growth and strength gains.',

Exercise physiologist Joel Hardwick calls it “probably the most functional exercise, and the one that you probably need most in your life.” In addition to your glutes and quadriceps, squats benefit your hip muscles, calves, hamstrings, and obliques.',

         details:'When in doubt, you can’t go wrong with good old-fashioned push-ups (or press-ups). The beauty of them is that they can be performed just about anywhere. Push-ups are great for building upper-body strength, working the chest, triceps, and shoulders primarily, as well as the lower back and core when done with proper form. How many push-ups you should do is based on your max number of reps. For example, if you can’t do more than 25 push-ups at once, aim for 50-75 total. If you’re able to comfortably do 50, go as high as 250.The pull-up is one of the most effective back-strengthening exercises, working the lats, traps, deltoids, biceps, and abs. If you don’t have a pull-up bar, you can achieve similar results with inverted rows by placing a sturdy broom or pole across two chairs. In addition to standard pull-ups (palms facing away), you can also do chin-ups (palms facing in) and neutral grip pull-ups (palms facing each other).High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is perfect for those who want to work up a good sweat but don’t have much time to work out. “HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low intensity recovery periods,” says Healthline, and best of all it can be done in as little as 10 minutes. Pamela Reif’s equipment-free guided workout is guaranteed to get your heart rate going and burn plenty of calories.',

         details:'The spacecraft is now one step closer to making a soft landing on the lunar surface.Named after the founder of the Indian space programme, Vikram Sarabhai, the lander carries the Pragyan rover. The separation of the lander from the propulsion module marks a crucial milestone in the mission.Following this, the lander will be put into a closer orbit around the Moon.The Chandrayaan-3 mission is currently in an orbit of 153 km x 163 km around the Moon. The next major event will be the selection of the landing site.Isro has expanded the landing area and chosen a spot with a 4 km x 2.4 km area, instead of 500 square meters during Chandrayaan-2. This decision was made to provide more flexibility for the landing attempt. The south-polar region of the Moon, despite its challenging terrain, is a highly valued target for scientists due to the potential presence of substantial amounts of ice. This could be useful for extracting fuel, oxygen, and even drinking water.  ',
